Inofficial git mirror of the Haskell package [HaskellForMaths](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HaskellForMaths).

Branch `upstream` tracks the original source code.

Branch `main` contains a few general fixes, but is essentially the same as upstream version 0.4.8.

Branch `tensoralg-excerpt` contains a heavily stripped down excerpt from upstream version 0.4.8, see its readme file for details.
